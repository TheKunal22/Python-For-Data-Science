    "# **Quick Guide To Numba**\n",
    "\n",
    "Numba is a just-in-time compiler for python that works best on code that uses Numpy arrays and functions,and loops.The most common way to use Numba is through its collection of decorators that can be applied to your functions to instruct Numba to compile them. When a call is made to a Numba decorated function it is compiled to machine code 'just-in-time' for execution and all or part of your code can subsequently run at native machine code speed!\n",
